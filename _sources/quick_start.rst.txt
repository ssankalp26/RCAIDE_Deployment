Introduction
============
RCAIDE (Research Community Aircraft Interdisciplinary Design Environment) is an
advanced, Python-based framework designed to revolutionize aerospace engineering
analysis and design. This comprehensive guide introduces the framework's core
concepts, architecture, and capabilities, helping users seamlessly transition from
`SUAVE <https://suave.stanford.edu/>`_ to RCAIDE's enhanced environment.

Code Philosophy
==================

RCAIDE represents the next evolution in aerospace design software, built on the
foundation that future aerospace innovations require sophisticated, collaborative
software methodologies. By providing an integrated, open-source environment,
RCAIDE empowers users to explore cutting-edge technologies, novel vehicle
configurations, and their broader impacts on society, economy, and environment.

Code Architecture
---------------

The RCAIDE ecosystem consists of two primary branches:

1. **RCAIDE**
   - **Framework:** Serves as the architectural backbone, integrating various
     components and providing core functionality.

   - **Libraries:** Houses modular, pure functions organized into logical domains.

2. **Regressions**
   - Comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability and validation.
   - Automated verification of framework functionality.

----------------------

RCAIDE's architecture follows a hierarchical structure optimized for clarity and
efficiency:

- AI/ML integration
- Model-based systems engineering (MBSE)

Each analysis type offers multiple fidelity levels, allowing users to balance
computational cost with required accuracy.

Workflow Examples
=================

1. Vehicle Mission Analysis
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        # Vehicle Definition
        vehicle = vehicle_setup()

        # Configuration Creation
        configs = configs_setup(vehicle)

        # Analysis Methods
        analyses = analyses_setup(configs)

        # Mission Profile
        mission = mission_setup(analyses)

        # Results Visualization
        plot_results(mission)


2. Performance Analysis
-----------------------

.. code-block:: python

    def analyze_performance():
        # Setup
        vehicle = vehicle_setup()

        # Analysis
        payload_range = compute_payload_range(vehicle)
        takeoff_performance = compute_takeoff(vehicle)

        # Visualization
        plot_performance_metrics(payload_range, takeoff_performance)


SUAVE Transition Support
